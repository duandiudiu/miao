    <p>The page you are viewing right now exists to show off what can be accomplished with pure <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/">CSS1</a>, and that's all. This
      variant on <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/demo.html">complexspiral</a>doesn't even use
      any<em>CSS2</em>to accomplish its magic. Remember: as you look this demo over, there
      is <em>no</em>Javascript here,
      nor are <i>any</i> <em>PNGs</em> being used, nor do
      I employ <i>any</i> proprietary extensions to
      <em>CSS</em> or any other
      language. It's all done using straight W3C-recommended markup and styling,
      all validated, plus a total of four (4)
      images.

      Unfortunately, not every browser supports all of <em>CSS1</em> ,
      and only those browsers which fully and completely support
      <em>CSS1</em>
      will get this right. Despite some claims to the contrary,
      <em>IE6</em> /Win's rendering of this page is <em>not</em> correct, as it
      (as
      well as some other browsers) doesn't correctly support
      <span class="size">background-attachment: fixed</span> for
      any element other than the
      <span class="size">body</span> .
      That makes it impossible to pull off the intended effect.
      Other browsers may or may not get the effect right.</p>
    <h2>Hands-on: Things to Examine</h1>
      <p class="">Before you start, make sure you're viewing this page in one of the browsers mentioned above
        . Otherwise
        the descriptions
        to follow won't match what you see.

        The first, easiest thing to do is scroll the page vertically.
        Make sure you scroll all the way to the very end
        of
        the
        page and back. Notice how the various areas with colored
        backgrounds also appear to distort the background image
        as if
        through mottled glass. Try changing the text size and
        notice how the compositing effect remains consistent. Then
        make
        your browser window really narrow and scroll horizontally.
        Again, everything should remain seamless and
        consistent.

        The demonstrated effect, that of having various elements
        backed with translucent rippled glass of varying hues,
        is
        only
        possible using fixed-attachment backgrounds in <em>CSS.</em>
        (Okay, maybe it could be done in Flash; I don't know.) I
        don't
        think
        it's even possible with <em>IE's</em> proprietary filters,
        but even if this effect is possible with filters, I could
        easily
        enough devise one that isn't.
      </p>
      <h2>I missed the original complexspiral demo-- how does this work?!?</h2>
      <p class="">
        <strong>Glad you asked. The effect demonstrated here is achieved by using fixed background images
          , nothing more. For
          example,
          the main-content area (the blue part here) uses the following
          styles for the default spiral-shell background:</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>
        div#content {background: white url(glassy-ripple.jpg) 0 0 no-repeat fixed;}
      </pre>
      <p>
        <strong>The above is equivalent to these styles:</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>
        div#content {
        background-color: white;
        background-image: url(glassy-ripple.jpg);
        background-position: 0 0;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-attachment: fixed;
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The effect of these longer rules is exactly the same;
        they're just split out into individual background
        properties
        for
        more detailed consideration by you, gentle reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, check out the rippled-shell image found
        here: <a href="https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/complexspiral/glassy-ripple.jpg">url(glassy-ripple.jpg).</a>
        Then come back to this page and
        I'll
        continue with the explanation. All done? Great.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <em>CSS</em> , any background image that is
        "fixed" using <span>background-attachment: fixed;</span> is fixed with
        respect
        to the
        <strong>viewport--</strong> <em>not</em> the element with which the image is
        associated. So I set the rippled-shell background image to
        be
        aligned
        with the top left corner of the browser window
        (the viewport) with the values given for background-position.
        However,
        the image will only be visible wherever
        is intersects with the element to which it's been assigned. Therefore,
        even
        though the top left corner of the rippled-shell image
        is aligned with the top left corner of the viewport, we
        can
        only
        see it wherever it intersects with a div that
        has an id with a value of content (which, again, happens to be
        the
        one
        containing this text).
      </p>
      <p>
        So I set a fixed background for the BODY,
        the content DIV, and H1 and H2 elements scattered through the
        document.
        In any
        given case of an element's display,
        we see whatever part of the associated background image intersects with
        the
        element.
        The rest of the background image remains hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's how it works.
      </p>
      <h2>I'm not seeing the compositing!</h2>
      <p>
        Then I'm willing to bet that you'
        re using Internet Explorer for Windows (any version), or possibly Opera
        (version
        6 or

        earlier). Neither of these browsers
        fully support background-attachment: fixed for elements other than body.
        In
        the case
        of both, images are fixed with respect
        to the elements that contain them, not the browser window, which is
        not
        what CSS1
        defines background-attachment: fixed to
        mean, although browsers are allowed to ignore fixed if they stick to
        CSS1
        (CSS2
        requires its implementation for conformance).
        And yes, this page uses a strict DOCTYPE, so IE6 is in "strict
        mode." I
        guess when Microsoft claims 100% CSS1
        compliance, they're referring to the CSS1 core (a reduced subset of
        CSS1)
        instead
        of the entirety of the CSS1 specification.
        It tends to make me wonder how limited or flawed their "full
        support"
        is for
        other key open specifications, like HTML and DOM.
